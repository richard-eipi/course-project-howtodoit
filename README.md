HowTodoit - a simple to do list app written in java

HowTodoit is a to-do list app written in java. The user will be able to interact with a virtual task manager (via command line) that is able to load data from and save data into local history (using Javaâ€™s Serializable interface).

The app will be built using Gradle and run in Corretto 11. It has a CLI (command line interface) and a GUI (graphic user interface with Javafx). Due to time limitations, the GUI will be similar to the CLI to some extent and the user will still need to type commands to perform the majority of the actions.

More details can be found in the "phase 2" folder.
